During the morning of the sad day, the girl found him unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m., and the guitar player was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital. Jimi was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, at the age of 27 after choking on his own vomit. Hendrix left the message 'I need help bad man', on his managers answer phone earlier that night. Rumors and conspiracy theories grew up around Hendrix’s death. Eric Burdon claimed Jimi had committed suicide, but that's contradicted by reports that he was in a good frame of mind. In 2009, former Hendrix and Animals roadie James ""Tappy"" Wright published a book claiming that Jimi’s manager had admitted to him that he arranged the murder of Hendrix, since the guitarist wanted out of his contract.";-;-;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jimi_Hendrix;no;Jimi Hendrix ;   ;   ;-;-;013g120817;
